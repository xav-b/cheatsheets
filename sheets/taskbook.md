# Taskbook

## Usage

[Project](https://github.com/klaudiosinani/taskbook)

With my Dojo/Sunsama inspired workflow

**Attach to boards**: `tb task @pro @must be promoted`

**Show a specific board**: `tb list board1 board2`

**Set priorities**: `tb t Do that maybe p:1` (1 to 3, from lowest to highest)

**Move an item to boards**: `tb mv @itemid board1 board2`

**Delete all completed tasks**: `tb clear`

Possible aliases:
- Put into the backlog: `tbl do this`

## Workflow

- Organise daily to do by `must`, `should`, `would`
- Also: `xs` for estimates
- `stash` for next
- `'blocked` for blocked stuff
- And a `calendar`, with... calendar events `tb event 04:30pm 1h CDA - Managers Weekly`
- Everything else goes to Backlog
- Projects also have their boards using tags
- Everyday `tb clear && tb list must should would calendar pending`
